----

This light PWA uses the [XKCD JSON](https://xkcd.com/json.html) version
to query a comic strip's data via AWS lambda functions (comfily through Netlify functions).

It's more of a silly learning project to dip my toes in serverless and Go.

It also displays the title/alt text of an image so you wouldn't have to hover and wait for it.\
_You're welcome._
